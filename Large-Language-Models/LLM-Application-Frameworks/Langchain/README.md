# Langchain 
**Langchain** focus on connecting LLMs with external data sources and tools, enables advanced and context aware applications.

## 1. LLM I/O 
- [LLM I/O](Models-Inputs-Outputs)

## 2. Chains

## 3. RAG 
**RAG** would be used when we make use of LLM to deal with the data that the LLM wasn't trained on. For example, information contained in a private document. The flow of RAG is **LEDVR** which involves:
- **L**: Loader
- **E**: Embedding
- **D**: Document Transformers
- **V**: VectorStore
- **R**: Retriever

## 4. Memory and Chatbot

## 5. Agents
**Agents** can decide which actions to take in order to complete a task by invokeing different tools (e.g Web-Search, Calculators, custom functions)
- [Langchain-Agent](agents/README.md)
