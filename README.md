## More on training Deep Neural Network

# Computer Vision
By leveraging deep neural networks, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computers can now perform complex visual tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and facial recognition. <br>
<br>
The key advantage of deep learning in computer vision lies in its ability to automatically learn hierarchical feature representations from raw pixel data. Unlike traditional computer vision approaches that relied heavily on hand-crafted features, deep learning models can discover intricate patterns and representations through training on large datasets.<br>
<br>

## Applying CNN on image classification
When applying neural networks to image classification tasks, we often encounter the challenge of handling an enormous number of parameters. To address this issue, convolutional layers are used instead of fully connected layers. This is because convolutional layers take advantage of two key properties: <b><i>locality</i></b> and <b><i>translation invariance</i></b>. <br>

## Transfer Learning with CNN
A pre-trained model, typically trained on a large dataset, is adapted to new but related task, instead of training a CNN from scratch. This is called <b><i>transfer learning</i></b>. <br>

## Object Detection with CNN
Object detection involves identifying and localizing objects within an image. Object detection, unlike image classification which assigns a single label to an entire image, classifies object and determines their positions using bounding boxes.
